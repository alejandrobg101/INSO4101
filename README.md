## Background

Over the last decade, the scope and quantity of entertainment media has increased dramatically. Tracking progress across multiple types of media is challenging, especially when many trackers specialize in only one or two media types. Premium-only tools further complicate the experience, creating high costs for users who want comprehensive tracking.

---

## Target & Scope

- **Objective:** Create a single application to track **all entertainment media types** for a user.  
- **Goal:** Simplify tracking, encourage exploration of new media, and minimize or eliminate costs from multiple trackers.  
- **Scope:** Movies, TV shows, video games, books, comics, and other forms of entertainment media.

## Problem Analysis

### Why do people use multiple trackers?

- Trackers are highly specialized for only 1–2 types of media.  
- Users must maintain multiple trackers to cover all interests.  

### Why are entertainment media tools specialized?

1. The amount of information per user is massive.  
2. Specialization is easier to market.  
3. Updates are slower if multiple media types are monitored.
